# Student Management System (C Implementation)

This is a command-line based Student Management System implemented in C programming language. It was developed during a 2-hour Lab Practical exam. The program allows users to perform various operations related to student records, such as adding new records, searching for records by enrollment number, modifying existing records, deleting records, displaying all records, and finding the student with the highest percentage.

## Features

- Add new student records with details like enrollment number, name, semester, and percentage
- Search for student records by enrollment number
- Modify student details such as name, semester, and percentage
- Delete student records by enrollment number
- Display all student records
- Display the details of the student with the highest percentage

## Implementation Details

The program utilizes a structure `stu` to store student information such as enrollment number, name, semester, and percentage. An array of `stu` structures is used to hold the student records. The program also includes various functions to perform different operations on the student records.

Please note that this implementation was developed under time constraints during a 2-hour Lab Practical exam. A more refined and object-oriented version of a similar system, an Employee Management System with more or less the same functionality, is available in the C++ implementation located in the parent folder of this repository.

## Usage

1. Compile the C source code using a compatible C compiler.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. The program will display a menu with various options.
4. Enter the corresponding choice number to perform the desired operation.
5. Follow the prompts to provide the necessary input (e.g., enrollment number, name, semester, percentage) for each operation.
6. To exit the program, select the "Quit" option (choice 7).
