# C++ Decimal/Hexadecimal Conversion Utility
This document outlines a C++ program designed to facilitate conversions between decimal and hexadecimal number systems.

# Features
1. Convert from decimal to other bases (including binary, octal, and hexadecimal).
2. Convert from other bases (including binary, octal, and hexadecimal) to decimal.
3. Accommodates large numbers using long long int variables.

# Known Issues
1. Incorrect handling of base multiples: The function may provide incorrect results for numbers that are multiples of the base (e.g., hexconv(16) should return "10" but might return an invalid value).
2. Error handling: The program does not explicitly handle invalid input (e.g., negative decimal numbers, non-numeric characters for hexadecimal input). Implementing input validation is recommended to prevent unexpected behavior.

# Usage
The program offers a menu-driven interface for conversion options. Users are prompted to enter the base and number for conversion.

# Example
To convert the decimal number 123 to hexadecimal:

- Enter the base (16 for hexadecimal).
- Enter the number in decimal (123).
- The program will output the hexadecimal equivalent (7B).

# Additional Notes
1. The system("cls") call in the fromdec function is system-specific and may not work on all platforms. Consider using platform-independent alternatives for clearing the console screen (if needed).
2. The code currently assumes base-10 input for decimal numbers. Modifications are required to support base-specific decimal input (e.g., leading "0b" for binary, "0" for octal).

# Future Improvements
1. Implement proper handling of multiples of the base in the function.
2. Add input validation for error handling.
3. Enhance code readability through comments and variable naming conventions.
